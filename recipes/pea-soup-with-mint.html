        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, sliced</li>
            <li>2 (10oz/300 grams) medium potatoes, diced</li>
            <li>3 ¼ cup (750ml) vegetable broth</li>
            <li>4 cups (600 grams) frozen peas</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp fine salt, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1-2 Tbs fresh mint leaves</li>
            <li>black pepper, to serve</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Garnish (optional)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 Tbsp cooked peas</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil, to drizzled</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp shaved parmesan cheese or crumbled feta</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp sesame seed or other seeds of your choice</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion and saute' for about 5 minutes until
                soft and translucent.</li>
            <li>Add the potatoes and the vegetable broth, bring to the boil, reduce the heat, cover with a lid and cook
                for 10 minutes, or until the potatoes are soft.</li>
            <li>Then add the peas and simmer for a further 5 minutes (no longer, or you will lose the fresh flavour and
                beautiful colour of the peas).</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat, season with salt, pepper, add the fresh mint leaves, and let it cool for a few
                minutes.</li>
            <li>Then, carefully transfer the hot soup to a blender, working in batches if necessary. (Do not fill past
                the maximum fill line or the soup could overflow!). If the soup is too thick for you, you can add some
                broth or water to thin it out until you have a consistency you like.</li>
            <li>Taste, make sure you're happy with the seasoning, and serve with black pepper, a drizzle of extra virgin
                olive oil and some parmesan cheese or crumbled feta if you wish.</li>
        </ol>
